Hello,
My name is Justin. I am a young teenager who is very interested in low-level system development. I have done everything from start a `unix like kernel`_ and work on a libc_ to building various_ IRC_ bots_.

I spend most of my time tinkering with the various piece of code I have lying around as well as researching different technological advancements.
Unlike many of my friends, I see challenges as fun puzzles. I meet many programmers who want to do things the lazy and cheap way instead of the right way. From `my github`_ I am sure you can see that I am willing to tackle almost any project imaginable.
I have started video games and kernels as well as projects people consider 'insane' like `writing a website in C++`_

Interists
---------

I am mostly interested in computers but I have found interest in Nuclear Physics, Quantom Physics, and world history (typically from Science channel and History channel).
I studied a lot of nuclear fission history, how it came to be, what it's failures were, and what the fallout of those failures were like. I find incidents like Chernobyl fascinating and I feel there's still a lot to learn about it.

I love electrical engineering as well as Computer science. I grew up learning a computer since I was about 6. I started learning how computers worked in 6th grade when I got my own and since that day I have been hacking apart computers, programming them, breaking them, and rebuilding them.

My all-time favorite games are Command & Conquer: Generals and Return to Castle Wolfenstein (which `open sourced!!`_) as well as Doom 3 (also `open sourced`).

I have many music interests although one of my music producing friends once told me "You like all the shit that has echos and reverb in it." which is true. I listen to a lot of music which has reverb, played in reverse, electronic, and the likes.
You can take a look at my `spotify profile`_ (`http <http://open.spotify.com/user/justasic>`_)

Politics
--------

Anyone who meets me knows I am extremely political. I will argue until your ears fall off and your face implodes but I usually am able to prove my points and back them up with facts.
I am passive in a work environment and I do not let politics get in the way of what I am doing or get into fights with people who don't want a fight.

My political position is Conservative Republican although recently I feel I associate more with the Libertarian party.

I am for small government, individual states rights, firearms, pro-life, and capitalism.
Contrary to popular belief, we are actually a `Constitutional Representative Republic`_

Personal Life
-------------

I am homosexual and I have had my fair share of boyfriends. I want everyone who reads this to know that this is not what defines me but is mearly a part of my personality. It does not affect my work ethic and most of the time people who meet me don't know I am gay.
I dress like any other heterosexual male my age and don't usually bring up homosexual topics unless asked.


Life Goals
----------

Unlike many people in this world I have few life goals. I am gay and I have no plans for children so that eliminates a major expense. Ultimately all I want is a nice house, a lot of computers and toys I can tinker with and learn from, a marriage, some property, and some friends.
